[In progress] [Does not compile]

Experimental prototype of a client - server 4X game on Unity.

Currently only UI and infrastructure code.

Used features:
- Multiple assemblies
- UI Toolkit
- UniTask library
- Leo ECS Lite on server, Unity ECS on client

Custom features:
- MVVM system with "reactive objects"
- UI framework organizing screens as a hierarchy of components (controllers)
- Flexible client-controlled API (resembling GraphQL philosophy)
